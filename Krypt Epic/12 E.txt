50% Basic Attacks unblockable chance.

[RAIN] At the start of the match, Rain creates an Aqueous Barrier for himself and his teammates that absorbs all damage from incoming Special Attacks. Once it absorbs damage, the barrier is lost.
For each active barrier, Rain's opponents' unblockable chance is reduced by 25%. For each depleted barrier, Rain's Critical Hit damage increases by 25%.
[RAIN][SET] If this is equipped alongside Hypocritical Cape, any DIAMOND Rain gains the ability to perform a Friendship. Once the opponent's Health is below 25% and the Friendship bar is filled up by performing multiple Special Attacks, a Friendship can be performed, ending the fight immediately.
Heal the weakest teammate for 20% of damage dealt on successful Basic Attacks.
