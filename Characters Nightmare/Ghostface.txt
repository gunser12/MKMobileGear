Attacks to get Billy's Ghostspirit 2
Attacks to remove Stu's Ghostspirit 2
Billy gains Ghostspirit on every 2 Basic Attack, giving him 5% damage boost for every stack. Max - 5 stacks. Billy can switch with Stu. Stu uses Shield upon switching, and removes Ghostspirit on every 2 Basic Attack. Each removed stack heals him for 7% of max health, and gives a 5% power generation boost.
If Billy has 5 Ghostspirits he becomes Manic for 13sec. on Special Attack 2, as he sees an impostor running out, and kills him in a rage. While Manic, Billy doesn't react to opponent's Basic Combo Attacks, has a 180% damage boost, and makes the opponent unable to tag-out.
Stu is scared, so while Manic Billy can't switch to him, use Special Attack 2 or Fatal Blow.
